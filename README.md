# SNAKE
Poorly coded snake game build using ncurses and C++. I built it for WSL and I don't know if it works anywhere else.

# BUILD
To build the program, run 'g++ main.cpp -lncurses -o snake'. To run it, run './snake' (NOTE: Works on ubuntu with ncurses installed, I don't know if it'll work otherwise)

# DEPENDANCIES
You will need to install ncurses ('sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev')
